## JAM :Collaborative Music Player 
# ⚠️ Note: This project is currently a work in progress. It’s being developed as part of my learning journey in Django and full-stack development.


This project is a full-stack web application built with Django (Python) and React (JavaScript). It is designed to explore the integration of a Django backend with a React frontend, demonstrating modern full-stack development concepts.

The goal of this project is to build a collaborative music-playing web app that integrates with the Spotify API, allowing multiple users to connect, share control, and listen to music together in real time.
